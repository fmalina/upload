# Upload with photo rotate/crop tools and python backend

Reusable web app to work with file and photo uploads.

- contains JS multifile drag and drop upload UI with instant
thumbnails and progress bars [upload/static/upload.js](upload/upload.js)
- python/PIL backend for upload, cropping, autocrop and rotation of photos
- seamless integration into Django projects
- image cropping UI (uses jQuery)

Thumbnails are generated using imagemagick.

Generic foreign key allows to associate uploads with any content object
(user profile, staff profile, message, album, page, gallery, listing).
This way uploaded files can be grouped into collections too.


## Installation (into a Django project)

To get the latest version from GitHub
```bash
pip3 install -e git+https://github.com/fmalina/upload.git#egg=upload
```
Add `upload` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...,
    'upload',
)
```
Configure your settings to suit, see upload/app_settings.py. You can use
the collection model provided.

Add the `upload` URLs to your `urls.py`
```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url(r'^upload/', include('upload.urls')),
]
```
Create your tables
```bash
./manage.py migrate upload
```
## Usage

### Setup a collection

This app supports multiple collections (or your custom model) with
multiple files in each collection.

### Add files

Drag and drop upload photos and files into your application. Files can
have alternative description and are orderable.

## Remarks

Upload shines best for sites that need ability to upload photo
galleries.

It will automatically shard the storage folder so as to not hit ext3
subfolder limit (\~32000 folders).

Included is also a backup management tool to sync/download publicly
uploaded files from server to a local machine.

### Integration

Simple integration works out of the box.

To upload files for any model taking advantage of generic foreign key,
link:
```html
<a href="{% url 'upload_edit' app_label model(lower) object_id %}">Upload</a>
```
So a profile picture upload link might look like:
```html
<a href="{% url 'upload_edit' 'auth' 'user' request.user.pk %}">Upload</a>
```
An important view to reuse or use as inspiration in a custom integration
is `views_post.FilesEditView`.

### Example settings
```python
import os

APP_ROOT = os.path.abspath(
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))

STATIC_URL = '/static/'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
STATIC_ROOT = APP_ROOT + STATIC_URL
MEDIA_ROOT = STATIC_ROOT + 'media/'
```
### Access control

You can control editing access by implementing `is_editable_by` method
on your collection model such as:
```python
def is_editable_by(self, user):
    if user.pk == self.user_id or user.is_staff:
        return True
    return False
```
The above ensures that a collection is only editable by its user and
staff.
